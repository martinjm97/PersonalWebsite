# A Simple Personal Website
Zack Holbrook, Kyle Swanson, and I created this template website to learn more about design frameworks (we chose [Ant Design](ant.design)) and typescript. The website is mobile-friendly and easily customizable.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
